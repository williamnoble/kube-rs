# kube-rs projects

Small projects written in Rust using kube-rs to interact with the Kubernetes API. I'm hoping to achieve some parity with the examples i've written in Go, but this repo is very much a WIP (along with my learning of Rust).


## pod-list
Uses kube-rs to list and watch resources. 

## hello-world-rs-operator
Small operator that watches for Member crd.
